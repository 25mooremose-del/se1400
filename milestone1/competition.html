        <h4>My competition is anyone with an all about me website,<br>
            mainly another guy named Moses Moore from Canada who<br>
            thinks he is all that and a bag of chips with his<br>
            "neat little website" my goal is to make a personal<br>
            website of my own that is classier and better than<br>
            his website.<br>
        </h4>
        <h2>What he does wrong</h2>
        <h4>
            The real question should be what does he do right, lol jk,</br>
            his website is very advanced with lots of intresting featrues</br>
            and sub pages but it lacks design and that "phizzaz" element.</br>
            His structure and lay out is fine but his website needs a design </br>
            overall.
        </h4>
        <h2>What I can do better</h2>
        <h4>
            I can make my website look sharper with images with better resolution, <br>
            a better and set color pallet, and improved strucutre and layout.
