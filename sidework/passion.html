                        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                        <p>
                            My name is Moses Moore, I was born in 2008 in Issaquah WA, but I grew up in Southern Utah.
                            I have 3 siblings and I am the second oldest. As of now I am in my senior year of high
                            school.
                            After high school I plan to serve a two-year mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of
                            Latter
                            Day Saints.
                            Outside of school I play Volleyball, watch movies, listen to music, and hang out with my
                            friends.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Why am I creating this website?</h2>
                        <p>
                            The main reason I'm making this website is because I'm enrolled in a college Web Development
                            class, so of course I gotta make a website. But, I love creating things and after I'm done
                            with
                            this class I don't want this website to be done with it. So this website is my passion
                            project
                            right now and in the future I want it to serve almost as a journal for my life, something I
                            can look back on in 10 years and see what my high school self was like.
                            Less seriously, when looking for inspiration on what website to create I stumbled upon
                            <a href="https://mozai.com/">this website</a>, which is a personal website created by
                            another
                            guy named Moses Moore, and is currently my biggest competition because I want my Moses Moore
                            website to be better than his (there can only be one).
