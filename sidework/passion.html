                <div class="image-wrap"></div>
                <p>My name is Moses Moore, I was born in 2008 in Issaquah WA, but I grew up in Southern Utah. I have 3
                    siblings
                    and I am the second oldest. As of now I am in my senior year of highschool. After highschool I plan
                    to serve
                    a two year misson for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Outside of school I play
                    Volleyball,
                    watch movies, listen to music, and hangout with my friends.
                </p>
                <h2> Why am I creating this website?</h2>
                <p> The main reason im making this webiste is because im enrolled in a college Web Development class, so
                    of course
                    I gotta make a website. But, I love creating things and after im done with this class I dont want
                    this website
                    to be done with it. So this website is my passion project rightnow and in the future I want it to
                    serve almost
                    as a journal for my life, something I can look back on in 10 years and see what my high school self
                    was like.
                    Less seriusly when looking for inspiration on what website to create I stumbled upon
                    <a href="https://mozai.com/">This webiste</a>, which is a personal webiste created by another guy
                    named Moses Moore,
                    is currently my biggest competition because I want my Moses Moore website to be better than his
                    (there can only be one)
